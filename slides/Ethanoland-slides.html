# Ethanol
## Price Analysis: A Fundamental Approach to the Study of Commodity Prices

---








---

#Ethanol

  + Ethanol production and consumption began to increase rapidly around 2005. 
  
  + The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 created the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). 
  
  + The RFS mandated quantities of ethanol that blenders of gasoline are required to blend into the retail gasoline supply. 
  
  + These annual mandates are revised every year, but they were designed to steadily increase year after year until 2015. 
  
  + The mandate reached 15 billion gallons per year. 
  
  + This figure came because gasoline consumption in the United States was forecast to reach 150 billion gallons per year by 2015. 
  
  
---

#Ethanol (CONT...)

  + The RFS mandates were designed to reach the point where the entire retail gasoline supply would include 10% ethanol. 

  + The EPA released [proposed rules] regarding RFS for volume requirements of biofuels for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 on May 31, 2016. 

|                                         | 	2014 |	2015	|  2016  |  2017    | % Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions |
|:----------------------------------------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:| :--------:|
| Cellulosic biofuel (million gallons)   	|  33    |  	123 |  	230	 |   312    | &gt; 60%     |
| Biomass-based diesel (billion gallons)  | 1.63   | 	1.73  | 	1.90 |	2.00    | &gt; 50%     |
| Advanced biofuel (billion gallons)      | 	2.67 | 2.88	  |  3.61  |  4.0     | &gt; 50%     |
| Total Renewable fuel (billion gallons)      	| 16.28  |	16.93 |	18.11  | 	18.8  | &gt; 20%  |

**Note:** Units for all volumes are ethanol-equivalent, except for biomass-based diesel volumes which are expressed as physical gallons.

---

#Ethanol (CONT...)

  + Advanced biofuel is defined as fuel made from renewable sources that provides greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than the renewable fuel they replace. 
  
  + Cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel are considered advanced biofuels. 
  
  + The cellulosic and biomass-based diesel requirements comprise 2.13 billion gallons of the 3.61 billion gallon advanced biofuel requirement. 
  
  + This leaves 1.48 billion billion gallons in undifferentiated advanced biofuel in the mandate. 
  
  + This will most likely be fulfilled by importing sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil. 
  
  + Since the greenhouse gas emission reductions for sugarcane-based ethanol is accepted as an advanced biofuel. 
  
  + And, considered to have greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
  
---

#Ethanol (CONT...)

  + Since ethanol production is a significant user of corn, and has important price impacts. 
  
  + It is useful to calculate the implied corn usage under the RFS mandates. 
  
  + First, with an 18.11 billion gallon total renewable fuel requirement, and a 3.61 advanced biofuel requirement. 
  
  + It leaves `\(18.11 - 3.61 = 14.5\)` billion gallons of the total renewable fuel requirement and can be met with conventional biofuel, like corn-based ethanol. 
  
  + Assuming an ethanol plant yields 2.8 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn, that is an implied usage mandate of 5.17 billion bushels corn. 
  
  + This is spot on with the November 2015 WASDE's estimate of Ethanol usage for the 2015/2016 marketing year of 5.175 billion bushels.

#Ethanol (CONT...)

  + Follow the basic ethanol production process is presented. 
  
  + By-product of ethanol production, distillers dried grains (DDGs), and its importance to the livestock industry. 
  
  + Some important price relationships involving ethanol, including the ethanol-RBOB gasoline price relationship, and the ethanol-corn-natural gas-DDGs price relationship. 

---

## Ethanol Production


  + Ethanol production takes place at biorefineries all across the country, but production is concentrated in the corn belt. 
  
  + Ethanol plants take advantage of the plentiful supplies of corn and the relatively favorable basis in the corn belt. 
  
  + Some plants are located close to major livestock feeding operations. 
  
  + If you click the source link for the map below and zoom in to look more closely at Kansas. 
  
  + You will see a few ethanol plants located in the vicinity of the cattle feedlots.  

  + The information about ethanol production predominately comes from the corn ethanol.

  + Corn-based ethanol can be produced via two methods. Dry grind, and wet grind.

---

### Dry Grind Ethanol Production

  + In dry grind ethanol production, the entire kernel of corn is ground into a meal and mixed with water to create a slurry. 
  
  + The enzymes are added to convert the starches in the slurry to simple sugar. 
  
  + Ammonia and yeast are added, and the yeast ferments the slurry and converts the slurry into ethanol and carbon dioxide. 
  
  + The ethanol is dehydrated to 200 proof and then a little gasoline is added to make the product undrinkable. 

  + The left over after the sugars have been converted to ethanol is called **Stillage**. 
  
---

### Dry Grind Ethanol Production (CONT...)

  + This product is dehydrated and sold as livestock feed called DDGs. 
  
  + The drying process usually is implemented with natural gas fueled furnaces. 
  
  + The natural gas is a significant input expense for dry grind ethanol plants. 
  
  + Dry-grind ethanol production involves two revenue streams, ethanol and Dd Gs. 
  
  + The ethanol plant is located directly next to the Key Cooperative, and both have access to a rail-head.

---

### Wet Grind Ethanol Production

  + Unlike dry grind ethanol production, in the wet grind process whole corn kernels are steeped in a combination of sulfuric acid and water to separate the kernel into its components: 
  
   + Pericarp (or skin) 
   
   + The endosperm (which contains the starch) 
   
   + And, germ (which contains the oil). 
   
  + Pre-processing the corn in this way allows fermentation to be done on the starchy part alone. 
  
  + Corn oil and corn bran (from the pericarp) can be extracted separately. 
  
  + The wet-grind ethanol production involves three revenue streams, ethanol, corn oil, and corn bran. 

  + Wet grind ethanol production is more costly than dry grind, so the majority of corn-based ethanol production capacity is of the dry grind type. 
---

## Distiller's Grains

  + DDGs are a by product of the dry grind ethanol production process that is valuable as a livestock feed. 
  
  + DDGs have about 26% protein, 8% fat, and significant metabolizable energy (kcals). 
  
  + It can be used to replace both energy (typically corn) and protein (soybean meal or other) requirements in feed rations. 
  
---

### DDG Prices

  + DDG prices tend to follow the trend of corn prices, although not perfectly because the two are not perfect substitutes. 
  
  + In Figure 3, DDG and corn prices are compared using:
  
   + Monthly U.S. average price received by farmers for corn (cents per bushel) 
   
   + And, the average wholesale bulk price for Central IL ($/ton).
   
---
### DDG Prices
   
  + We put corn prices in cents per bushel so the units are comparable on one axis. 

  + It is also informative to look at the price ratio of DDG and corn prices. This is displayed in Figure 4. 

  + The price ratio is fairly variable, but appears to follow a stationary and possibly mean reverting pattern. 
  
  + DDG prices seem to range from 30% to 50% of corn prices.

## Ethanol Prices

  + Since, ethanol is used as a liquid motor fuel, it makes sense that demand follows the same general trend that other energy products like crude oil and gasoline. 
  
  + Ethanol is both a substitute and a compliment for gasoline. 
  
  + Blending ethanol at 10% with retail gasoline displaces, or substitutes for some quantity of gasoline. 
  
  + E85, 85% blend of gasoline, clearly substitutes for gasoline, although the size of the E85 market is small relative to the size of the retail gasoline market. 


---

## Ethanol Prices (CONT...)

  + Ethanol is also a compliment with gasoline because it acts as an oxygenate. 
  
  + Oxygenates are added to retail gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and soot.  
  
  + By blending ethanol into retail gasoline blenders do not have to add other costly oxygenates derived from fossil fuel, such as:
  
   + MTBE (which is outlawed in California and New York among others)
   
   + Others
   
---

## Ethanol and Gas Prices

  + It is difficult to anticipate whether Ethanol prices will exhibit a relationship consistent with a substitute or consistent with a complement good. 
  
  + In Figure 5, ethanol and RBOB gasoline prices are graphed together for comparison. 

  + It appears that ethanol and Los Angelos spot RBOB have a positive relationship consistent with substitute goods. 
  
  + Ethanol prices are usually discounted relative to gasoline prices. 
  
  + Geographical differences in transport costs likely explain part of this, but also, a gallon of ethanol has about 75% of the energy content of a gallon of gasoline. 
  
  + Gasoline with ethanol blended into it will yield fewer miles per gallon and particularly true for E85.

## Ethanol Crush Spread

  + The price relationship between ethanol, its coproduct DDGs and its inputs, corn and natural gas, is also closely followed by the industry.
  
  + We have recently ended a period of rapid expansion in the ethanol industry. 
  
  + **Blending Margins** or the profitability of a typical ethanol plant were closely monitored to gauge how fast or slow we might expect future expansion. 
  
  + Although expansion has slowed, industry participants still follow the margin closely. 
  
  + To determine the health of the industry and whether we can expect any idling of capacity or expansion.
  
---

## Ethanol Crush Spread (CONT...)

  + Iowa State University Extension maintains an excellent spreadsheet model of ethanol economics. 
  
  + If you are involved in the commodity of ethanol industry. 
  
  + You will want to state up to date with the contents of the ISU model and what it says about economic conditions for ethanol production.

  + Similar to the soybean crush, cattle crush, and crack spread, there exists futures contracts for ethanol, corn. 
  
  + This means that much of the ethanol production margins can be hedged or speculated on as we saw in the spreads. 
  
---

## Ethanol Crush Spread (CONT...)
  
  + There are some limitations to this crush spread. 
  
  + The ethanol futures contract does not attract high trading volumes, which increases trading costs through higher Bid-Ask spreads. 
  
  + Also, there is no ddg futures contract, which means to hedge this revanue stream you have to use a cross hedge with with corn futures.
  
---

**The ethanol producer's profit is roughly,** 

1. `\(P_{eth}*q_{eth} + P_{DDG}*q_{DDG} - P_{corn}*q_{corn}\)`

  + A bushel of corn will yeild 2.8 gallons of ethanol and 17 lbs of ddgs, when processed into ethanol. 
  
  + Also, DDGs prices are quoted in $/tons, so we will need to convert that price to lbs (as we did for soybean meal). To calculate the Ethanol Crush, or the Gross Processing Margin (GPM), in terms of $/bushel of corn processed. 
  
  + We need to to convert the prices of ethanol, and DDGs similarly to what we did for the soybean crush.
  
---

## Ethanol Crush Spread (CONT...)


2. `\(P_{eth}*2.8 + P_{DDG}*17/2000 - P_{corn}\)`

  + Equation 2 gives the GPM per bushel of corn processed into ethanol. 
  
  + Dividing `\(17/2000 = 0.0085\)` yields 

3. `\(P_{eth}*2.8 + P_{DDG}*0.0085 - P_{corn}\)`

---

![](assets/ECrushSpread.png)
---

## Hedging the Crush Spread

  + Like soybean crushers, ethanol producers can use futures contracts to hedge their profitability. 
  
  + Ethanol producers buy corn and sell ethanol and DDGs. 
  
  + The appropriate hedge trades would be to buy corn futures and sell (one month later) ethanol futures. 
  
   + An ethanol futures contract is for `\(29,000\)` gallons of ethanol (the amount that will fill one typical train car).
   
---

## Hedging the Crush Spread (CONT...)

  + Two corn futures contracts produces just about one ethanol futures contract worth of ethanol, since 

`\(10,000\)` bu corn `\(= 10,000*2.8\)` gallons, or `\(28,000\)` gallons of ethanol.  

  + Therefore a 2-1 ratio of corn to ethanol contracts hedges the purchase of corn and the sale of ethanol, which will reduce the variability in GPM.

  + In this case, the sale of DDGs would remain unhedged. 
  
  + Since, one bushel of corn weighs about `\(56lbs\)` and one bushel of corn yeilds `\(17lbs\)` of DDGs, by weight. 
  
---

## Hedging the Crush Spread (CONT...)
  
  + The producer gets back `\(17/56 = 0.30\)` in DDGs and the price of DDGs tracks the price of corn closely as we observed above. 
  
  + Intuitively, by hedging the purchase of corn and not the sale of DDGs. 
  
  + The ethanol producer would effectively be overhedged on the purchase of corn. 
  
  + With no viable futures contract for DDGs, the producer cannot directly solve this problem. Instead they can use a **cross hedge**. 

---

## Cross Hedging 

  + When there is no futures contract for exact product or commodity that one needs to hedge. 
  
  + Another futures contract whose price is highly correlated with the commodity you need to hedge can be used. 
  
  + We already observed above that the prices of DDGs and corn futures are highly correlated. 
  
  + So, it may be beneficial to use corn futures to hedge the sale of DDGs. 
  
---

### Minimize the Variance of Cash Flow with Optimal Hedge Ratio for DDGs and Corn Futures

  + To develop the concept of a **Cash flow variance minimizing** optimal hedge ratio. 
  
  + Lets step back to the simpler example of a farmer hedging a crop of grain. 
  
   + We saw that the spot prices a farmer recieves is not exactly equal to the futures price for corn. 
   
   + Factors like transportation cost and local supply and demand conditions in the spot market make the basis. 
   
   + Or, the difference between spot and futures prices, variable. 
   
   + If this variability is too high, it may not be optimal to hedge with a 1-1 cash and futures position, even for the simple case of a farmer's short hedge. 
   
---

### Minimize the Variance of Cash Flow with Optimal Hedge Ratio for DDGs and Corn Futures (CONT...)

**The farmer's hedged cash flow**

`\(CashFlow(t) = S(t) - b[F(t) - F(0)]\)`  
`\(CashFlow(t) = S(0) + S(t) - S(0) - b[F(t) - F(0)]\)`  
`\(CashFlow(t) = S(0) + \Delta S(t) - b\Delta F(t)\)`  


Where `\(S(t)\)` is the spot price at time `\(t\)`, `\(F(t)\)` is the futures price at time `\(t\)`, and `\(b\)` is the number of futures contracts used to hedge one 'contracts' worth of grain. 

---

### Minimize the Variance of Cash Flow with Optimal Hedge Ratio for DDGs and Corn Futures (CONT...)

**Now examine the variance of this cash flow.**

`\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[S(0) + \Delta S(t) - b\Delta F(t)]\)`  
`\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[\Delta S(t) - b\Delta F(t)]\)`  
`\(Var[CashFlow(t)] = Var[\Delta S(t)] + b^2Var[\Delta F(t)] - 2bCov[\Delta S(t),\Delta F(t)]\)`

Now, naturally we want to minimize the variance of cash flow, so we can minimize this with respect to `\(b\)` (take the derivative with respect to `\(b\)`).

Find the optimal number of futures contracts to use to hedge. 

---

### Minimize the Variance of Cash Flow with Optimal Hedge Ratio for DDGs and Corn Futures (CONT...)

**First order condition:** 

`\(0 = 2bVar[\Delta F(t)] - 2Cov[\Delta S(t),\Delta F(t)]\)`  

Solving for `\(b\)`, 

`\(b = \frac{Cov[\Delta S(t),\Delta F(t)]}{Var[\Delta F(t)]}\)`

This, you may recognise, happens to be the coefficient estimate if we were to use linear regression to regress changes in spot price on changes in futures prices. 

`\(\Delta S(t) = \beta_0 + b\Delta F(t) + \epsilon(t)\)`

This means we can use historical prices to estimate the relationship between spot and futures prices, which yields the optimal hedge ratio for hedging the spot price with futures.
