# Introduction

In this Chapter we describe the physical process of converting soybeans into meal and oil, as well as the price relationship that is maintained between these highly related commodities. We saw in the chapter, 'Forecasting Use of Soybeans in the WASDE Balance Sheet,' that approximately half of the supply of soybeans in the U.S. is crushed into soybean meal and oil. Nearly all of the remainder of soybean supply is exported where most of it will be crushed abroad.

# Oilseed Processing

Now the most prevalant method for crushing soybeans is a method that uses a solvent to extract the oil from the soybean. Basically, soybeans are pretreated, then flaked to destry the cell walls so the solvent can get at the oil in the cells. A crude oil is then further prcesssed refined to remove the solvent and other compounds leaving only pure soybean oil. The soybean flakes, minus the oil are then ground in to meal that can be used as a high protein livestock feed. 

Hisorically, soybeans were processed by feeding soybeans into a mechanical press that literally squeezed the oil out. This process is less efficicent and more time consuming - thus more costly. Nearly all commercially crushed soybeans are done with with the solvent extraction method. 

Crushing soybeans yields about 11lbs of oil and 44lbs meal per bushel of soybeans, these yields can vary slighly, but most use these values in the price analysis that will follow.

# Soybean Oil Uses

Soybean oil is used primarily as a food-grade product. It is not usually found in grocery stores as 100% soybean oil, but it will be present in oil branded as 'cooking oil' - where it is blended with other edible oils like corn oil and canola (also known as rapeseed) oil. Composition of cooking oil can vary from one purchase to the next as producers of cooking oil can blend the edible oil components based on relative prices. 

Soybean oil also can be futher processed into partially hydrogenated soybean oil. This is accomplished by literally adding hydrogen to the vegatable oil. The resulting product is widely used in processed food such as baked goods, crackers, frozen foods; it is used in a lot of processed foods generally speaking. It is a perfect ingredient in processed foods because it is solid at room temperature, and essentially never goes bad. If natural vegatable oils were used in processed foods the oil would go rancid in a short period of time. 

Use of partially hydrogenated vegatable oils will decrease in coming years. Partially hydrogenated vegatable oils are examples of what is commonly referred to as *trans fat* in nutritional articles (and on the back of nutrition labels). Trans fat has been shown to [increase LDL cholesteral and heart disease](http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm372915.htm) [@dri2002Nap]. The FDA announced a ban on most added trans fats in processed foods; the ban is set to take effect by 2018.

Soybean oil is also used in the production of biodiesel. This amounts to a small percentage of the total soybean oil produced, however.

# Soybean Meal Uses

Soybean meal is used exclusively for livestock feed as a high protein component. Beef cattle are fed soybean meal in a limited manner, with dairy cattle, hogs, and poultry using soybean meal more prevalently in feed rations. Soybean meal provides a good source of protein, and combined with cereal grains like corn allow a complete balence of essential amino acids that hogs and poultry must have.

# Price Relationships 

Since the input (soybeans) and outputs (oil and meal) are all commodities, and the production techology is fairly widely understood and replicable, the oilseed crushing business is a very competitive one. Recall from intermediate microeconomics that in the long run firms in a competitive market with identical technology (identical production functions) should not expected to earn economic profits or losses in the long run. If short-term profits exist, firms enter the market, shifting the supply curve out and reducing the equilibrium price until there is no more incentive to expand. This simple prediction has implications for our expectations about the relative prices of these commodities. 

An soybean processer's profit is roughly, 

1. $P_{oil}*q_{oil} + P_{meal}*q_{meal} - P_{soybean}*q_{soybean}$

where $q_{oil}$ and $q_{meal}$ are the quantities of oil and meal produced from $q_{soybeans}$. Since the quantities in this profit expression are always in fixed proportion to the amount of soybeans processed, we can replace the quantities with $q_{oil} = 11$ and $q_{meal} = 44$ to get profit per bushel of soybeans processed. 

2. $P_{oil}*11 + P_{meal}*44 - P_{soybean}$

Now we are only focused on the price relationship. One consideration we need to adjust for is the units of the prices. Soybean oil is quoted in $\$/lb$ so the $P_{oil}*11$ does not need further adjustment. Soybean meal, however, is quoted in $\$/ton$, so to put the price on a $lbs/bushel$ basis we need to divide by 2000lbs, $P_{meal}*44/2000$ or $P_{meal}*0.022$.

So, adjusting equation 2. we get the expression for the **Crush Spread**. 

3. $P_{oil}*11 + P_{meal}*0.022 - P_{soybean}$

and this represents the **Gross Processing Margin** (GPM) for the soybean crushing plant. This spread is followed by industry participants as a gauge of profitability in the industry and as a signal of whether to expect expansion or contraction in the crush business.

# The Board Crush

Since soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal all have actively traded futures contracts, the oil proccessing GPM calculated with futures prices is widely followed, along with the local crush spread oil processers would earn in their local cash markets. When the Crush Spread is calculated with futures prices instead of spot prices it is sometimes called the 'Board Crush' short-hand for the 'Board of Trade' Crush. Speculators trade this spread by selling (buying) oil and meal and buying (selling) soybeans. Oil processers use the Board Crush to hedge their positions in the cash markets for oil, meal, and soybeans and to 'lock in' processing margins. 

## The 1-1-1 Spread

One version of the board spread is called the 1-1-1 spread and it requires placing the following trades: 

- Buy 1 contract soybean oil 
- Buy 1 contract soybean meal
- Sell 1 contract soybeans

This position makes money when the spread widens, or oil and meal go up while soybeans goes down. This is called buying the spread. 

Another version is to sell the spread.

- Sell 1 contract soybean oil 
- Sell 1 contract soybean meal
- Buy 1 contract soybeans

This spread makes money when the spread narrows, or oil and meal go down while soybeans goes up.

The 1-1-1 spread is a crude approximation of oil processing GPM but one needs to be careful about the quantities of each commodity represented. Futures contracts for soybean oil, soybean meal, and soybeans are for the following quantities: 

- Soybean oil  ~ 60,000lbs
- Soybean meal ~ 100 short tons or 200,000lbs
- Soybeans     ~ 5,000 bushels

So that 1 contract of soybeans (5,000 bu) will produce

- $5,000*11 = 55,000$ lbs of soybean oil
- $5,000*44 = 220,000$ lbs of soybean meal

So the 1-1-1 spread does not represent equivalent quantities of soybeans, oil, and meal. 

## The 9-11-10 Spread

The commercial oil processers use a 9-11-10 spread of 9 contracts of soybean oil, 11 contracts of soybean meal, and 10 contracts of soybeans. 

Then the quantities match more closely. Ten contracs of soybeans produces

- $5,000*10*11 = 550,000$ lbs of soybean oil
- $5,000*10*44 = 2,200,000$ lbs of soybean meal

and the quantities of oil and meal represented by 9 and 11 contracts are as follows:

- $9*60,000 = 540,000$ lbs of soybean oil
- $11*200,000 = 2,200,000$ lbs of soybean meal

So the quantities match except for 10,000 lbs short on soybean oil coverage.
