Crude oil spillovers to both corn and ethanol markets are somewhat similar in timing and magnitude, but moderately stronger to the ethanol market. The shares of corn and ethanol price variability directly attributed to volatility in the crude oil market are generally between 10\%-20\%, but reached nearly 45\% during the financial crisis, when world demand for oil changed dramatically. Volatility transmission is also found from the corn to the ethanol market, but not the opposite. The findings provide insights into the extent of volatility linkages among energy and agricultural markets in a period characterized by strong price variability and significant production of corn-based ethanol.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1114653109},
	abstract = {Climate change is likely to alter the spatial distributions of species and habitat types but the nature of such change is uncertain. Thus, climate change makes it difficult to implement standard conservation planning paradigms. Previous work has suggested some approaches to cope with such uncertainty but has not harnessed all of the benefits of risk diversification. We adapt Modern Portfolio Theory ({MPT}) to optimal spatial targeting of conservation activity, using wetland habitat conservation in the Prairie Pothole Region ({PPR}) as an example. This approach finds the allocations of conservation activity among subregions of the planning area that maximize the expected conservation returns for a given level of uncertainty or minimize uncertainty for a given expected level of returns. We find that using {MPT} instead of simple diversification in the {PPR} can achieve a value of the conservation objective per dollar spent that is 15\% higher for the same level of risk. {MPT}-based portfolios can also have 21\% less uncertainty over benefits or 6\% greater expected benefits than the current portfolio of {PPR} conservation. Total benefits from conservation investment are higher if returns are defined in terms of benefit–cost ratios rather than benefits alone. {MPT}-guided diversification can work to reduce the climate-change–induced uncertainty of future ecosystem-service benefits from many land policy and investment initiatives, especially when outcomes are negatively correlated between subregions of a planning area.},

We propose that a long-run no-profit condition is established in distant futures markets for ethanol, corn and natural gas and then use the theory of storage to define an inter-temporal equilibrium among these prices. The relationship shows that under certain conditions, future price expectations will influence nearby futures prices and that a short-term relationship between input and output prices will exist.

We find enforcement of the cellulosic mandate is costly in that it raises equilibrium prices of all three crops through competition for acreage. However, crude oil prices largely determine industry profitability even in the face of high crop prices. Further we find that uncertainty in crude oil prices and crop yields causes higher corn, soybean, and switchgrass prices compared to a baseline with no uncertainty. ({JEL} Q21, Q42)},

This paper contributes to the literature on the economics of conservation in the face of climate change uncertainty. It advances a new method for using modern portfolio theory to choose lands to protect that yield total conservation returns with less uncertainty. It explores the implications for portfolio recommendations of variation in the correlations between ecological and land-value responses to climate change. It also tests the robustness of the method to shortcuts that might be taken to simplify analysis, identifying problems that arise if conservation costs are ignored in portfolio analysis and demonstrating when portfolio recommendations are sensitive to how ecological benefits are quantified.},

In our model, we compare the case of a regulator who sets the emission cap and price ceiling to be consistent with a long run emission objective with the case of a regulator who occasionally is motivated to deviate from the optimal long run regulatory policy in order to correct for unexpected but exceptionally high emissions. Using a discrete dynamic programming model with stochastic emissions, we show that the hybrid model gives the regulator a degree of freedom in making an optimal price and quantity choice.},

Both corn and soybeans exhibited a downward trend in the cost of forward contracting for January delivery, in contrast to previous pre-harvest results, and the March delivery cost of forward contracting is slightly downward sloped. The cost of post-harvest forward contracting corn and soybeans averaged 2 cents and 6 cents respectively; this was much less than the cost of pre-harvest forward contracting in recent years. We did not find an increase in cost associated with income shifting associated with January delivery. We conclude that January forward contracts offer a relatively inexpensive means of smoothing income across years.},

	abstract = {Forward contracting historically has been the principal risk management tool of crop farmers in the United States. We use pre-harvest forward contract bids from 1977 to 2013 in Illinois to estimate the cost of forward contracting corn and soybeans. Prior to 2007, it cost 1.55\% of the October spot price or 3.74 cents/bushel on average to forward contract corn at the end of February. In 2007–2013, a period of high price volatility, the average cost increased to 3.31\% or 16.40 cents/bushel. In the soybean market, before 2007 the average cost was 0.77\% or 6.26 cents/bushel and thereafter increased to 1.46\% or 15.62 cents/bushel. Default risk does not appear to be a determinant of forward contracting cost. However, evidence suggests that the higher cash flow risk associated with volatile market prices is likely to be the main driving cause of increasing forward contracting costs observed after 2007.

This article assembles data on 26 different conservation cases in three distinct ecological settings and develops new metrics to evaluate how well {MPT} can reduce uncertainty in future outcomes of a set of environmental investments. We find {MPT} is broadly but not universally useful and works best when multiple investments have negatively correlated outcomes across climate scenarios; a second-best investment has expected value almost as good as the value in the best investment; or multiple investments have little uncertainty in ecological outcomes.},

A recent study translates Markowitz's risk-diversification strategy from finance to conservation settings, enabling conservation agents to use this diversification strategy for allocating conservation and restoration investments across space to minimize the risk associated with such uncertainty. However, this method is information intensive and requires a large number of forecasts of ecological outcomes associated with possible climate-change scenarios for carrying out fine-resolution conservation planning. We developed a technique for iterative, spatial portfolio analysis that can be used to allocate scarce conservation resources across a desired level of subregions in a planning landscape in the absence of a sufficient number of ecological forecasts. We applied our technique to the Prairie Pothole Region in central North America. A lack of sufficient future climate information prevented attainment of the most efficient risk-return conservation outcomes in the Prairie Pothole Region. The difference in expected conservation returns between conservation planning with limited climate-change information and full climate-change information was as large as 30\% for the Prairie Pothole Region even when the most efficient iterative approach was used. However, our iterative approach allowed finer resolution portfolio allocation with limited climate-change forecasts such that the best possible risk-return combinations were obtained. With our most efficient iterative approach, the expected loss in conservation outcomes owing to limited climate-change information could be reduced by 17\% relative to other iterative approaches.},

Using Huang and Stoll's (1997) model of liquidity costs, we estimate whether changes to liquidity costs are driven by its adverse selection, inventory, or order processing components. Commodity index fund roll activity reduces the asymmetric information cost component of liquidity cost due to an increased proportion of noninformation-based trading, but the inventory cost component increases as (mostly long only) commodity index funds sell their nearby positions and buy the first deferred contract—raising liquidity providers’ risk of building a position. The sum of these two effects is that liquidity costs remain low during index fund roll periods, averaging one “tick” (0.25 cents). On {USDA} report release days, we find that informed traders raise the asymmetric information component of liquidity costs in the first hour after release, but the inventory cost component is reduced due to the increase in volume. Similar to index fund roll activity, liquidity costs on {USDA} report release days remain low, averaging one “tick”. Our findings that liquidity costs are minimally changed during {USDA} report releases and commodity index fund roll periods is consistent with other recent research on liquidity costs, but we show that what drives liquidity costs differs substantially depending on the circumstances surrounding daily trading.},

Absent, however, is a well‐functioning equity market in farmland real estate, or well‐developed indexes of farmland returns that might contribute to the development of tradable shares tied to farmland returns, or to methods to hedge the value of owned agricultural assets. The purpose of this study is to empirically present relevant measures related to farmland returns and other financial assets to provide a broad context for evaluation of farmland investments in a portfolio context. Issues related to the development of a farmland fund and index construction are discussed along with major risk and transactional factors that are somewhat unique to the asset class. Design/methodology/approach – Returns data from a broad set of financial categories and broad set of agricultural returns measures are developed and presented in multiple frameworks to convey temporal persistence, relatedness, and portfolio considerations related to farmland. Issues related to the construction of claims based on agricultural assets are discussed. Findings – Agricultural real estate investments have performed well compared to most other financial assets on most traditional measures of risk adjusted performance. However, the difficulties in direct investment remain and the need to develop securitized conduit exposures to farmland returns is identified. Originality/value – The study presents a unique set of farmland returns measures and examines the stability of the statistics used to describe these through time. Novel characterizations of the data compared to traditional assets helps investors and asset owners accurately understand the exposure to farmland returns.},

In both markets, the nearby contract loses dominance when its relative volume share dips below 50\%, which typically occurs when the nearby is close to maturity. Regression results indicate that the share of price discovery is mainly related to trading volume and time to expiration in both markets. In the corn market, price discovery share between nearby and deferred contracts is also related to inverse carrying charges, crop year differences, {USDA} announcements, market crashes, and commodity index position rolls. Differences between corn and live cattle markets are consistent with differences in the contracts’ liquidity and commodity storability.},

We follow this with a comparison of the historical performance of two variable blending policies, namely one that is based on crude oil prices and one that is based on ethanol-blending margins. A comparison of a variable credit and the present fixed rate policy shows that a variable tax credit can achieve program savings, by providing incentives to the ethanol industry only when it would experience losses without support from the tax credit.},

The government, through National Food Authority ({NFA}) has sought to establish stocks and control imports to stabilize prices since its establishment in 1972 to support farm gate prices and reduce retail price of rice. But data shows divergence in retail prices and farm prices since mid 1960s. In this paper, we use vector autoregression ({VAR}) to analyze the movement of Philippine rice margins with government stocks and weather supply shocks to able to determine government effectiveness in actual times of market stress. Comparing {VARs} across regions, we are able to identify the regions in which price margins are significantly affected by government intervention measures.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The authors aim to investigate what influences a Farm Credit System association to make a patronage refund payment. In particular, they seek to investigate what causes the regional heterogeneity in the patronage refund payment decision. It is unclear whether patronage refunds have been used more as a capital management tool or as a member recruitment and retention tool. This study aims to bring some clarity to this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use an empirical logistic model to estimate the probability of a positive patronage refund payment by a Farm Credit System association, controlling for variables related to the associations' balance sheet as reported in the associations' quarterly call reports. Findings – The authors find there is evidence that Farm Credit Service associations use patronage refunds as a capital management tool, at least in part. However, they also find that there are still significant regional differences in the patronage refund payment decision even after controlling for variables affecting the associations' balance sheet. The authors conclude that this likely represents member heterogeneity in preferences for patronage refunds versus a discounted interest rate. Originality/value – The present study is one of the few empirical papers to examine a broad panel of financial cooperatives. Because of this, the authors' paper provides valuable insight into the aggregate behavior of Farm Credit Service associations, particularly into whether they use patronage refunds as a capital management tool, or as a marketing and retention tool.},

Several alternatives have been proposed, which include eliminating the blender’s credit and maintaining the mandate, implementing a producer’s income or investment tax credit or creating a variable blender’s credit. Eliminating the blender’s credit only has market impacts when the mandate is not binding. An ethanol producer’s income tax credit has market impacts that are indistinguishable from the current blender’s credit. A producer’s investment tax credit has the potential to reduce the risk of entry for biofuel products. A variable ethanol blender’s tax credit can achieve significant cost savings over a fixed blender’s tax credit while achieving the same objectives. These cost savings can then be used to reduce program costs to taxpayers or be used to achieve additional objectives.},

We show that policy changes will impact one market directly and the other indirectly, generating unequal price responses that affects the spread between the two compliance instruments. We show how the price spread between allowances and offsets is affected by market conditions such as the offset import limit, abatement and offset cost, penalty rate, emission cap, and baseline emissions.},

We apply our analysis to markets in U.S., Nord Pool, and Australia. We show that {ARCH} and time-dependent jumps are important statistical features of price volatility across all hubs in each market but with different levels of intensity. We also find that inferences about the role of seasonality components are sensitive to modeling of the {ARCH} and jump features.},

We develop a class of Poisson–Gaussian models of the Fed Funds rate to capture surprise effects, and show that these models offer a good statistical description of short rate behavior, and are useful in understanding many empirical phenomena. Jump (Poisson) processes capture empirical features of the data which would not be captured by Gaussian models, and there is strong evidence that existing Gaussian models would be well-enhanced by jump and {ARCH}-type processes. The analytical and empirical methods in the paper support many applications, such as testing for Fed intervention effects, which are shown to be an important source of surprise jumps in interest rates. The jump model is shown to mitigate the non-linearity of interest rate drifts, so prevalent in pure-diffusion models. Day-of-week effects are modelled explicitly, and the jump model provides evidence of bond market overreaction, rejecting the martingale hypothesis for interest rates. Jump models mixed with Markov switching processes predicate that conditioning on regime is important in determining short rate behavior.},

One of the main contributions of the paper is the inclusion of a jump component, with a non-constant intensity process (probability of occurrence of jumps), in the short-term factor. We model the stochastic behaviour of the underlying (unobservable) state variables by Affine Diffusions ({AD}) and Affine Jump Diffusions ({AJD}). We obtain closed form formulas for the price of futures contracts using the results by Duffie, Pan and Singleton (Econometrica, 2000). We provide empirical evidence on the observed seasonality in risk premium, that has been documented in the {PJM} market.

Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

	abstract = {[The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900 when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less. These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and the new "down-and-out" option are derived. The effects of dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined. The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.]},

	abstract = {The Black–Scholes  or Black–Scholes–Merton model is a mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. From the partial differential equation in the model, known as the Black–Scholes equation, one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the option has a unique price regardless of the risk of the security and its expected return (instead replacing the security's expected return with the risk-neutral rate). The formula led to a boom in options trading and provided mathematical legitimacy to the activities of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and other options markets around the world. It is widely used, although often with some adjustments, by options market participants.Based on works previously developed by market researchers and practitioners, such as Louis Bachelier, Sheen Kassouf and Ed Thorp among others, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes demonstrated in 1968 that a dynamic revision of a portfolio removes the expected return of the security, thus inventing the risk neutral argument. In 1970, after they attempted to apply the formula to the markets and incurred financial losses due to lack of risk management in their trades, they decided to focus in their domain area, the academic environment. After three years of efforts, the formula—named in honor of them for making it public—was finally published in 1973 in an article entitled "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities", in the Journal of Political Economy. Robert C. Merton was the first to publish a paper expanding the mathematical understanding of the options pricing model, and coined the term "Black–Scholes options pricing model". Merton and Scholes received the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work, the committee citing their discovery of the risk neutral dynamic revision as a breakthrough that separates the option from the risk of the underlying security. Although ineligible for the prize because of his death in 1995, Black was mentioned as a contributor by the Swedish Academy.The key idea behind the model is to hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and, as a consequence, to eliminate risk. This type of hedging is called "continuously revised delta hedging" and is the basis of more complicated hedging strategies such as those engaged in by investment banks and hedge funds.
The model's assumptions have been relaxed and generalized in many directions, leading to a plethora of models that are currently used in derivative pricing and risk management. It is the insights of the model, as exemplified in the Black–Scholes formula, that are frequently used by market participants, as distinguished from the actual prices. These insights include no-arbitrage bounds and risk-neutral pricing (thanks to continuous revision). Further, the Black–Scholes equation, a partial differential equation that governs the price of the option, enables pricing using numerical methods when an explicit formula is not possible.
The Black–Scholes formula has only one parameter that cannot be directly observed in the market: the average future volatility of the underlying asset, though it can be found from the price of other options. Since the option value (whether put or call) is increasing in this parameter, it can be inverted to produce a "volatility surface" that is then used to calibrate other models, e.g. for {OTC} derivatives.},

            We study the effect of algorithmic trading ({AT}) on market quality between 2001 and 2011 in 42 equity markets around the world. We use an exchange colocation service that increases {AT} as an exogenous instrument to draw causal inferences about {AT} on market quality. On average, {AT} improves liquidity and informational efficiency but increases short-term volatility. Importantly, {AT} also lowers execution shortfalls for buy-side institutional investors. Our results are surprisingly consistent across markets and thus across a wide range of {AT} environments. We further document that the beneficial effect of {AT} is stronger in large stocks than in small stocks.},

	abstract = {We show that the U.S. agricultural price support system, and certain other government insurance programs, can be interpreted as the provision of a random number of put options to program beneficiaries. Because the number of puts being supplied is random, the value of the guarantees is no longer given by the standard Black-Scholes put option formula. This paper uses the contingent-claims methodology of modern finance theory to derive an appropriate valuation formula for such programs. We estimate the value to farmers of agricultural price supports for several commodities covered by the U.S. agricultural price support system. Our results indicate that the current system raises the ex ante value of some crops by as much as 9 percent. The method of valuation is applicable to other forms of government guarantees, as well, such as exchange rate insurance and export subsidy guarantees.},
